greetings, desert corner,
a haven of peace, work and inspiration,
Where the invisible stream of my days flows
In the bosom of happiness and oblivion.
I am yours — I have exchanged a vicious court for Circe,
Sumptuous feasts, amusements, delusions
On the peaceful noise of the oak trees, on the silence of the fields,
On idleness free, a friend of reflection.
I am yours-I love this dark garden
With its coolness and colors,
this meadow, covered with fragrant ricks,
where the bright streams in the bushes are noisy.
Everywhere before me are moving pictures:
Here you can see the two lakes of the azure plain,
Where the fisherman's sail turns white sometimes,
Behind them a row of hills and fields are striped,
Scattered huts in the distance,
On the wet banks of the wandering herds,
The smoky barns and mill krylati;
There are traces of contentment and work everywhere…
I am here, freed from the shackles of vanity,
Learning to find bliss in the truth,
To worship the law with a free soul
, Not to listen to the murmur of the unenlightened crowd,
The fate of answering a shy plea
And do not be jealous of fate
A villain or a fool - in the greatness of the wrong.
Oracles of the ages, here I ask you!
In the privacy of the majestic
Hear your glad voice.
He drives laziness sleep sullen,
To work gives rise to the heat in me,
And your creative thoughts
in the soul mature depth.
But a terrible thought here darkens the soul:
Among the flowering fields and mountains
A friend of humanity it is sad to notice
Everywhere ignorance is a murderous shame.
Not seeing tears, not heeding groans,
To the destruction of people chosen by fate,
